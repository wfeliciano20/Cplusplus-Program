# Banking APP (Compound Interest Calculator)

The project is a Compound Interest Calculator that generates reports for initial deposits without monthly payments and for deposits with monthly contributions. The program was implemented as an object-oriented application, with a separate class for the CompoundInterest Calculator and the main loop and menu system separated into another file. One of the strengths of the project was the use of OOP concepts in its implementation.

There are still opportunities to enhance the code by implementing more core class features, such as a copy constructor, destructor, and assignment operator. These improvements would make the code more efficient and robust, making it less susceptible to failures if used in a production application. One possible solution to enhance the code further would be to use pointers.

The most challenging part of the project was the report generation process using the initial balance and monthly deposits. A considerable amount of time was spent fine-tuning this method. In terms of support, the developer relied on online resources and tools to overcome these challenges.

The skills gained from this project are highly transferable to other projects and coursework. The way of implementing a class and using OOP concepts can be applied to other programming projects.

To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, the developer followed a good styling guide and added comments to clarify the program's inner workings. These measures made the program more readable, understandable, and easier to maintain.
