# Banking APP (Compound Interest Calculator)

This Project is a simple Compound Interest Calculator that prints some reports without monthly payments after opening deposit and with monthly deposits

What did you do particularly well?
I was able to implement an oop application creating a class for the CompoundInterest Calculator and separating the core loop and menu system to another file.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My code could be enhanced by implementing more core class features like a copy constructor destructor assingment operator and maybe implement the code utilizing pointers.This improvements will help make this implementation more robust and less prone to failures if the class were to be enhanced and used in a production app.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging piece of code to implement was the reports using initial balance only and the other one using initial balance plus monthly deposits.It fine tunnign this methods is where I spend the most time.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
From this project I could carry forward the way of implementing a class and using the OOP concepts.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to use good styling guides and added comments where I believe necessary to clarify the programs inner works. By following this styling guides and commenting were appropiate the program is more readable and maintainable since it is more clear how everything works.
